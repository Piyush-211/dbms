Course(coursecode, coursename, syllabus)
Batch(batchcode, coursecode, startingdate, duration, coursefees, netincome, expectedincome)
Enquiry(enquirynumber, fname, lname, coursecode, plotno, street, city, phone, enquirydate,
enquirystatus)
Enrollment(rollno, enquirynumber, batchcode, enrollmentdate) Write following Mysql queries: 1. Display
the contents of batch for particular course having coursecode=10 2. Display the batchcode of batch having
expectedincome more than netincome by 2000 3. Display the coursename, startingdate of all batches
4. Find out coursename with coursefees greater than 50000
5. Display the details of batch having a specified coursename.
6. Find out the number of persons whose name starts with „S‟.
7. Delete all rows from enquiry for a specified coursename.


SELECT * FROM Batch WHERE coursecode = 10;
SELECT batchcode FROM Batch WHERE expectedincome > (netincome + 2000);
SELECT Course.coursename, Batch.startingdate
FROM Batch
INNER JOIN Course ON Batch.coursecode = Course.coursecode;
SELECT coursename FROM Course WHERE coursefees > 50000;
SELECT *
FROM Batch
WHERE coursecode = (SELECT coursecode FROM Course WHERE coursename = 'specified_coursename');
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_persons_starting_with_S FROM Enquiry WHERE fname LIKE 'S%';
DELETE FROM Enquiry WHERE coursecode = (SELECT coursecode FROM Course WHERE coursename = 'specified_coursename');
