emp (eno, ename, bdate, title, salary, dno)
proj (pno, pname, budget, dno)
dept (dno, dname, mgreno)
workson (eno, pno, hours)

SELECT proj.pname, workson.hours, workson.pno
FROM workson
INNER JOIN proj ON workson.pno = proj.pno
WHERE workson.hours > 10;

SELECT proj.pname, dept.dname, proj.budget
FROM proj
INNER JOIN dept ON proj.dno = dept.dno
WHERE proj.budget < 50000;

SELECT emp.eno, emp.salary
FROM emp
INNER JOIN dept ON emp.dno = dept.dno
WHERE dept.dname = 'Consulting'
ORDER BY emp.salary DESC;

SELECT emp.ename, proj.pname, emp.title, workson.hours
FROM workson
INNER JOIN emp ON workson.eno = emp.eno
INNER JOIN proj ON workson.pno = proj.pno;
